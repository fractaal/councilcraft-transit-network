# Implementation Summary: Sequence-Based Audio System

## What's Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Complete Feature List

1. **Configurable Audio Sequences**
   - Per-station custom announcement sequences
   - Automatic station ID matching (e.g., `station_cloud_district` ‚Üí `CLOUD_DISTRICT` sequence)
   - Fallback sequence for unknown stations
   - Easy to add new stations

2. **DFPWM Audio Support**
   - Full support for real audio file playback
   - Downloads from GitHub raw URLs
   - Dual-layer caching (disk + memory)
   - Automatic fallback to noteblock sounds

3. **Preloading System**
   - All sounds downloaded on startup
   - Loaded into memory for instant playback
   - No network latency during gameplay

4. **Sequence Playback**
   - Multi-sound sequences play in order
   - Automatic timing calculation
   - Smooth transitions between sounds

#### Lines 398-484: Audio Configuration
```lua
audio.config = {
    base_url = "PLACEHOLDER_BASE_URL",  -- Set to your GitHub raw URL
    cache_dir = "/sounds/",

## How to Use

### 1. Prepare Your Audio Files

You already have:
- ‚úÖ `sound_sources/ALIGHT_HINT.wav`
- ‚úÖ `sound_sources/ARRIVAL_CLOUD_DISTRICT.wav`
- ‚úÖ `sound_sources/ARRIVAL_DRAGONSREACH.wav`
- ‚úÖ `sound_sources/ARRIVAL_PLAINS_DISTRICT.wav`
- ‚úÖ `sound_sources/ARRIVAL_CITY_HALL.wav`
- ‚úÖ `sound_sources/ARRIVAL_GENERIC.wav`
- ‚úÖ `sound_sources/DEPARTURE_CART_DEPARTING.mp3`

Still needed:
- ‚ùå `sound_sources/SG_MRT_BELL.wav` - The Singapore MRT arrival bell

### 2. Convert to DFPWM

**Option A: Using the script**
```bash
./convert_sounds.sh
```

**Option B: Manual conversion**
```bash
ffmpeg -i sound_sources/ALIGHT_HINT.wav -ac 1 -ar 48000 -f dfpwm sounds/ALIGHT_HINT.dfpwm
ffmpeg -i sound_sources/ARRIVAL_CLOUD_DISTRICT.wav -ac 1 -ar 48000 -f dfpwm sounds/ARRIVAL_CLOUD_DISTRICT.dfpwm
# ... etc for each file
```

### 3. Upload to GitHub

```bash
git add sounds/
git commit -m "Add DFPWM audio files"
git push
```

### 4. Configure `transit.lua`

Edit line 406:
```lua
base_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fractaal/councilcraft-transit-network/main/sounds/",
```

Replace `fractaal` with your GitHub username if different.

### 5. Deploy to Minecraft

```bash
# In-game on each computer:
update
reboot
```

## Expected Behavior

### On Startup
```
CouncilCraft Transit Network
Station Controller v0.9
========================

Station ID: station_cloud_district
Line ID: red_line

Opening modem...
Modem opened on channel 100
Speaker found! Audio enabled.

Preloading audio library...
  [OK] SG_MRT_BELL
  [OK] ARRIVAL_CLOUD_DISTRICT
  [OK] ALIGHT_HINT
  [OK] DEPARTURE_CART_DEPARTING
Loaded 4/4 sounds

Waiting for DISCOVER from ops center...
```

### When Cart Arrives at Cloud District
1. üîî Plays `SG_MRT_BELL.dfpwm` (bell chime)
2. üó£Ô∏è Plays `ARRIVAL_CLOUD_DISTRICT.dfpwm` ("Arriving at Cloud District")
3. üö™ Plays `ALIGHT_HINT.dfpwm` ("Please alight here")

### When Cart Arrives at Unknown Station
1. üîî Plays `SG_MRT_BELL.dfpwm` (bell chime)
2. üó£Ô∏è Plays `ARRIVAL_GENERIC.dfpwm` (generic announcement)
3. üö™ Plays `ALIGHT_HINT.dfpwm` ("Please alight here")

### During Departure
- üì¢ Continuously plays `DEPARTURE_CART_DEPARTING.dfpwm` (door closing chirp)

## System Architecture

### Audio Flow

```
Startup:
  1. Station boots up
  2. Discovers speaker peripheral
  3. Calls audio.preloadAll()
  4. Downloads all sounds from GitHub
  5. Caches to /sounds/ directory
  6. Loads into memory (audio.cache)
  7. Ready for instant playback!

Cart Arrival:
  1. Cart detected on rail
  2. Calls audio.playArrivalChime(speaker, station_id)
  3. Looks up sequence for station_id
  4. Plays each sound in sequence with pauses
  5. Falls back to noteblock if DFPWM fails

Cart Departure:
  1. DISPATCH received from ops center
  2. State changes to DEPARTING
  3. Calls audio.playDoorClosingChirp(speaker) in loop
  4. Plays departure sound continuously
  5. Falls back to noteblock chirp if DFPWM fails
```

### Cache Strategy

1. **Memory cache** (`audio.cache`): In-RAM storage for instant access
2. **Disk cache** (`/sounds/`): Persistent storage to avoid re-downloading
3. **Remote source** (GitHub): Original source of truth

Lookup order: Memory ‚Üí Disk ‚Üí Download ‚Üí Fallback to noteblock

## Configuration Reference

### Adding a New Station

1. Record announcement: `sound_sources/ARRIVAL_NEW_STATION.wav`
2. Convert: `ffmpeg -i sound_sources/ARRIVAL_NEW_STATION.wav -ac 1 -ar 48000 -f dfpwm sounds/ARRIVAL_NEW_STATION.dfpwm`
3. Add to library (line ~430):
   ```lua
   ARRIVAL_NEW_STATION = "ARRIVAL_NEW_STATION.dfpwm",
   ```
4. Add sequence (line ~470):
   ```lua
   NEW_STATION = {
       "SG_MRT_BELL",
       "ARRIVAL_NEW_STATION",
       "ALIGHT_HINT"
   },
   ```
5. Commit, push, run `update` in-game

### Customizing Sequences

Change what plays for each station:

```lua
-- Minimal (bell only)
CLOUD_DISTRICT = {
    "SG_MRT_BELL"
},

-- Extended (add multiple announcements)
CLOUD_DISTRICT = {
    "SG_MRT_BELL",
    "ARRIVAL_CLOUD_DISTRICT",
    "ALIGHT_HINT",
    "MIND_THE_GAP"  -- Add more sounds!
},

-- Different bell
CLOUD_DISTRICT = {
    "CUSTOM_CHIME",  -- Use a different sound
    "ARRIVAL_CLOUD_DISTRICT",
    "ALIGHT_HINT"
},
```

### Disabling DFPWM

To use only noteblock sounds (no downloads):

```lua
audio.config = {
    base_url = "PLACEHOLDER_BASE_URL",
    enable_dfpwm = false,  -- Disable DFPWM
    preload_sounds = false
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Find/record the Singapore MRT bell sound** (`SG_MRT_BELL.wav`)
2. **Convert all sounds to DFPWM** (run `convert_sounds.sh`)
3. **Upload to GitHub** (`git add sounds/ && git commit && git push`)
4. **Set your GitHub URL** in `transit.lua` line 406
5. **Deploy to Minecraft** (run `update` on each computer)
6. **Test!** Let a cart arrive at each station and hear the custom announcements

## Troubleshooting

**No sounds playing:**
- Check `base_url` is set correctly (not PLACEHOLDER)
- Verify files exist on GitHub (visit raw URL in browser)
- Check `/sounds/` directory exists in-game: `ls /sounds/`
- Look for errors during preload on startup

**Wrong announcement:**
- Station ID must match sequence key
- Example: `station_cloud_district` ‚Üí strips `station_` ‚Üí `CLOUD_DISTRICT`
- Check station ID on startup screen
- Check sequence keys in `audio.sequences` (lines 447-484)

**Files not downloading:**
- Ensure HTTP is enabled in ComputerCraft config (default: enabled)
- Check internet connectivity in-game
- Try manually: `http.get("your_github_url")`

**Sounds cut off or overlap:**
- Adjust timing in `audio.playSequence()` (line 630)
- Current: `duration = #audio_data / 6000` (6KB per second)
- Increase buffer: `sleep(duration + 0.5)` for more pause between sounds

Enjoy your immersive, station-specific transit network! üéâ
